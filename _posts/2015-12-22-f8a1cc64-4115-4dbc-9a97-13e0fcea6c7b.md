  CHANGE Our album, “Las Noches De Diciembre” was recorded and produced in 2005.
  Even The Blue Nile put albums out faster than we do. We have been working on
  various personal projects since and in 2015 managed to get back into the
  studio. All the songs for the next album are written and we should have it out
  before Summer 2016. Perhaps.
