    CHANGE Our album, “Las Noches De Diciembre” was recorded and produced in
    2005. Even The Blue Nile put albums out faster than we do. We have been
    working on various personal projects since and in 2015 managed to get back
    into the studio. All the songs for the next album are written and we should
    have it out in early 2017. Perhaps.
